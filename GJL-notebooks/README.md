# Gary Larson's personal notes folder
This folder holds ipython notebooks which contain my study notes while learning Python from the Python Data Science Handbook.

### Many notebooks contain YAML front matter at the beginning
It is my intention to use some / all of the notebooks as blog entries on my website [garylarson.github.io](garylarson.github.io). For this reason, the ipython notebooks will have at the beginning a block of raw text that serves as the YAML frontmatter for the blog post. This way, when I export from JuptyerLab the `.ipynb` file as a `.md` file, it will be ready to reside somewhere in the `/content/...` folder of my blog files and be properly rendered when I build the website in Hugo.
